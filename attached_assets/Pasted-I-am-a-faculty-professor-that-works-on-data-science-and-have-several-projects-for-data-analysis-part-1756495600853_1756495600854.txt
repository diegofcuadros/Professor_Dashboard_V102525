I am a faculty professor that works on data science and have several projects for data analysis particularly using health data for africa and the US. I currently have several grad students and postdocs. But i am finding difficult to manage them so i need help. I was thinking on developing an AI Agent that helps me keeping track on the progress of each student. Let's discuss about the features of this ai agent, just read and understand the following description of the AI agent I have, just confirm you understand the task and wait for my next instruction:

Lab Intelligence AI Agent (LIA) - Comprehensive System Description
Executive Summary
The Lab Intelligence AI Agent (LIA) is a comprehensive research team management system designed specifically for academic data science laboratories working with health data projects. This AI-powered platform combines intelligent progress tracking, automated communication, schedule management, and predictive analytics to help faculty professors efficiently manage multiple graduate students and postdocs while ensuring consistent productivity and research quality. The system enforces structured work habits through transparency and accountability while providing personalized insights that enable proactive intervention before problems arise.
Core Purpose and Vision
LIA transforms the traditionally chaotic process of managing multiple concurrent research projects and team members into a streamlined, data-driven operation. By automating routine supervisory tasks and providing intelligent insights, the system allows professors to focus on high-value mentorship while ensuring no student falls through the cracks. The platform creates a culture of accountability and structured progress without micromanagement, fostering both independence and productivity in research teams.
